      <p>The Pomeranian is a compact, short-backed, active toy dog of Nordic descent. The double coat consists of a short dense undercoat with a profuse harsh-textured longer outer coat. The heavily plumed tail is one of the characteristics of the breed. It is set high and lies flat on the back. He is alert in character, exhibits intelligence in expression, is buoyant in deportment, and is inquisitive by nature. The Pomeranian is cocky, commanding, and animated as he gaits. He is sound in composition and action.</p>
      <p>The Pomeranian is a Nordic breed which takes its name from the province of Pomerania, now located in Germany. It was bred down to its current 3 to 7 pound toy size from larger ancestors which were used for herding and for pulling sleds. Their popularity was greatly enhanced by Queen Victoria of England, who owned the first Pomeranians to be shown. Pomeranians come in a wide variety of coat colors and patterns. These spirited, loving and loyal dogs excel in the show ring, companion events and as therapy dogs in nursing homes and hospitals.</p>
